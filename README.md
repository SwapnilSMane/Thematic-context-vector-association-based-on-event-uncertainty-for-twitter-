# Thematic-context-vector-association-based-on-event-uncertainty-for-twitter

One of the important steps in text mining is keyword extraction. The extraction of keywords with respective contextual events in twitter data is a big challenge due to language informality such as acronyms, misspelled words, synonyms, transliteration, and ambiguous terms. The extraction of keywords in current systems is pattern based or event based. In this paper, keywords are extracted using contextual events with the help of data association.  The thematic context vectors for events are identified using uncertainty principle in the proposed system.   The system is tested on the twitter COVID-19 dataset and proves to be effective. The system extracts event specific thematic context vectors from the test dataset and ranks them.  The extracted thematic context vectors are used for the clustering of contextual thematic vectors which improves silhouette coefficient by 0.5% than state of art methods namely TF and TF-IDF. The thematic context vector can be used in other applications like Cyber bullying, sarcasm detection, figurative language detection etc.
